# About

I’m Stephano, a cybersecurity student, writer, and youth soccer coach based in Seattle who is passionate and hungry about cybersecurity. I’m a 30 year old guy interested in offensive security, threat analysis, bug hunting, and the stories people tell. 

Between 2017 and 2023 I traveled a lot - across the United States, to Canada, through South America, to Asia. I worked odd jobs, published poems, studied philosophy, played electronic music at art shows, among other things. On the technical side, I taught myself how to create 3D environments in Blender, read programming code, program simple games and tools in Python, and I learned blockchain analysis and OSINT to sleuth wallets in the blockchain with a team of sleuthers over Discord and Darknet forums.

While working in restaurants and only getting older, I started to think deeper about my future and my skills. So my cybersecurity journey started in mid 2023 when my friend introduced me to a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) and the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast. Since then, I've been obsessed with ethical hacking and cybersecurity. I installed Kali Linux and started experimenting with tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper, Rustscan, Wifite, Wireshark, and Burp. I registered with [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/DRIFT0R), HackerOne, and enrolled in WGU's [B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html) program to learn all the fundamentals.  

Today, I'm sharpening my skills in cybersecurity with the hopes of having a career in the field. Outside of that, I'm either writing, reading, doing PNW things outdoors or playing/coaching soccer.
