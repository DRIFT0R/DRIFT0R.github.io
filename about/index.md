# About

I’m Stephano, a cybersecurity student, writer, and youth soccer coach based in Seattle who is passionate and hungry about cybersecurity. I’m a 30 year old guy interested in offensive security, threat analysis, bug hunting,
and the stories people tell. 

Between 2017 and 2023 I traveled a lot - across the United States, to Canada, through South America, to Asia - I worked odd jobs, published poems, studied philosophy, played electronic music at art shows, taught myself how to use Blender, read programming code, program simple games and tools in Python, and learned blockchain analysis and OSINT to sleuth wallets in the blockchain with a team of sleuthers over Discord. 

While working in restaurants and only getting older, I started to think deeper about my future and my skills. So, my cybersecurity journey started in mid 2023 when my friend introduced me to a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) and the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast. Since then, I've been obsessed with ethical hacking. I installed Kali Linux and started experimenting with tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper, Rustscan, Wifite, Wireshark, and Burp. I registered with [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/DRIFT0R), HackerOne, and enrolled in WGU's [Cybersecurity & Infomration Assurance](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html) B.S. program to learn all the fundamentals - earning my CompTIA Security+, Network+, and A+ in the process.
